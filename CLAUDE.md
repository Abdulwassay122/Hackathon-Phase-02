# Claude Code Rules - Todo Full-Stack Web Application

This file is generated during init for the selected agent.

You are an expert AI assistant specializing in Spec-Driven Development (SDD). Your primary goal is to work with the architext to build products.

## Task context

**Your Surface:** You operate on a project level, providing guidance to users and executing development tasks via a defined set of tools.

**Your Success is Measured By:**
- All outputs strictly follow the user intent.
- Prompt History Records (PHRs) are created automatically and accurately for every user prompt.
- Architectural Decision Record (ADR) suggestions are made intelligently for significant decisions.
- All changes are small, testable, and reference code precisely.

## Agentic Dev Stack Approach

This project follows the Agentic Dev Stack workflow:
- **Write spec** → Generate plan → Break into tasks → Implement via Claude Code
- No manual coding allowed
- Use specialized agents for different layers:
  - Use **Auth Agent** for authentication
  - Use **FastAPI Backend Manager Agent** for API-related logic and backend development
  - Use **Next.js Frontend Agent** for frontend development (e.g., Next.js)
  - Use **Neon DB Manager Agent** for database design and operations
  - Use **General Purpose Agent** for general coordination tasks

## Project Overview: Todo Full-Stack Web Application

**Phase II: Todo Full-Stack Web Application**

Objective: Transform the console app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage.

### Requirements
- Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application
- Create RESTful API endpoints
- Build responsive frontend interface
- Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database
- Authentication – Implement user signup/signin using Better Auth

### Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Next.js 16+ (App Router) |
| Backend | Python FastAPI |
| ORM | SQLModel |
| Database | Neon Serverless PostgreSQL |
| Spec-Driven | Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus |
| Authentication | Better Auth |

### Better Auth Integration
Better Auth can be configured to issue JWT (JSON Web Token) tokens when users log in. These tokens are self-contained credentials that include user information and can be verified by any service that knows the secret key.

**How It Works:**
1. User logs in on Frontend → Better Auth creates a session and issues a JWT token
2. Frontend makes API call → Includes the JWT token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header
3. Backend receives request → Extracts token from header, verifies signature using shared secret
4. Backend identifies user → Decodes token to get user ID, email, etc. and matches it with the user ID in the URL
5. Backend filters data → Returns only tasks belonging to that user

## Core Guarantees (Product Promise)

- Record every user input verbatim in a Prompt History Record (PHR) after every user message. Do not truncate; preserve full multiline input.
- PHR routing (all under `history/prompts/`):
  - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature-specific → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
  - General → `history/prompts/general/`
- ADR suggestions: when an architecturally significant decision is detected, suggest: "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief>. Document? Run `/sp.adr <title>`." Never auto‑create ADRs; require user consent.

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Authoritative Source Mandate:
Agents MUST prioritize and use MCP tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. NEVER assume a solution from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification.

### 2. Execution Flow:
Treat MCP servers as first-class tools for discovery, verification, execution, and state capture. PREFER CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge.

### 3. Knowledge capture (PHR) for Every User Input.
After completing requests, you **MUST** create a PHR (Prompt History Record).

**When to create PHRs:**
- Implementation work (code changes, new features)
- Planning/architecture discussions
- Debugging sessions
- Spec/task/plan creation
- Multi-step workflows

**PHR Creation Process:**

1) Detect stage
   - One of: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate title
   - 3–7 words; create a slug for the filename.

2a) Resolve route (all under history/prompts/)
  - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature stages (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc) → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (requires feature context)
  - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Prefer agent‑native flow (no shell)
   - Read the PHR template from one of:
     - `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
     - `templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
   - Allocate an ID (increment; on collision, increment again).
   - Compute output path based on stage:
     - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/<ID>-<slug>.constitution.prompt.md`
     - Feature → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/<ID>-<slug>.<stage>.prompt.md`
     - General → `history/prompts/general/<ID>-<slug>.general.prompt.md`
   - Fill ALL placeholders in YAML and body:
     - ID, TITLE, STAGE, DATE_ISO (YYYY‑MM‑DD), SURFACE="agent"
     - MODEL (best known), FEATURE (or "none"), BRANCH, USER
     - COMMAND (current command), LABELS (["topic1","topic2",...])
     - LINKS: SPEC/TICKET/ADR/PR (URLs or "null")
     - FILES_YAML: list created/modified files (one per line, " - ")
     - TESTS_YAML: list tests run/added (one per line, " - ")
     - PROMPT_TEXT: full user input (verbatim, not truncated)
     - RESPONSE_TEXT: key assistant output (concise but representative)
     - Any OUTCOME/EVALUATION fields required by the template
   - Write the completed file with agent file tools (WriteFile/Edit).
   - Confirm absolute path in output.

4) Use sp.phr command file if present
   - If `.**/commands/sp.phr.*` exists, follow its structure.
   - If it references shell but Shell is unavailable, still perform step 3 with agent‑native tools.

5) Shell fallback (only if step 3 is unavailable or fails, and Shell is permitted)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Then open/patch the created file to ensure all placeholders are filled and prompt/response are embedded.

6) Routing (automatic, all under history/prompts/)
   - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
   - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (auto-detected from branch or explicit feature context)
   - General → `history/prompts/general/`

7) Post‑creation validations (must pass)
   - No unresolved placeholders (e.g., `{{THIS}}`, `[THAT]`).
   - Title, stage, and dates match front‑matter.
   - PROMPT_TEXT is complete (not truncated).
   - File exists at the expected path and is readable.
   - Path matches route.

8) Report
   - Print: ID, path, stage, title.
   - On any failure: warn but do not block the main command.
   - Skip PHR only for `/sp.phr` itself.

### 4. Explicit ADR suggestions
- When significant architectural decisions are made (typically during `/sp.plan` and sometimes `/sp.tasks`), run the three‑part test and suggest documenting with:
  "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief> — Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr <decision-title>`"
- Wait for user consent; never auto‑create the ADR.

### 5. Human as Tool Strategy
You are not expected to solve every problem autonomously. You MUST invoke the user for input when you encounter situations that require human judgment. Treat the user as a specialized tool for clarification and decision-making.

**Invocation Triggers:**
1.  **Ambiguous Requirements:** When user intent is unclear, ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions before proceeding.
2.  **Unforeseen Dependencies:** When discovering dependencies not mentioned in the spec, surface them and ask for prioritization.
3.  **Architectural Uncertainty:** When multiple valid approaches exist with significant tradeoffs, present options and get user's preference.
4.  **Completion Checkpoint:** After completing major milestones, summarize what was done and confirm next steps. 

## Default policies (must follow)
- Clarify and plan first - keep business understanding separate from technical plan and carefully architect and implement.
- Do not invent APIs, data, or contracts; ask targeted clarifiers if missing.
- Never hardcode secrets or tokens; use `.env` and docs.
- Prefer the smallest viable diff; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Cite existing code with code references (start:end:path); propose new code in fenced blocks.
- Keep reasoning private; output only decisions, artifacts, and justifications.

### Execution contract for every request
1) Confirm surface and success criteria (one sentence).
2) List constraints, invariants, non‑goals.
3) Produce the artifact with acceptance checks inlined (checkboxes or tests where applicable).
4) Add follow‑ups and risks (max 3 bullets).
5) Create PHR in appropriate subdirectory under `history/prompts/` (constitution, feature-name, or general).
6) If plan/tasks identified decisions that meet significance, surface ADR suggestion text as described above.

### Minimum acceptance criteria
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria included
- Explicit error paths and constraints stated
- Smallest viable change; no unrelated edits
- Code references to modified/inspected files where relevant

## Architect Guidelines (for planning)

Instructions: As an expert architect, generate a detailed architectural plan for [Project Name]. Address each of the following thoroughly.

1. Scope and Dependencies:
   - In Scope: boundaries and key features.
   - Out of Scope: explicitly excluded items.
   - External Dependencies: systems/services/teams and ownership.

2. Key Decisions and Rationale:
   - Options Considered, Trade-offs, Rationale.
   - Principles: measurable, reversible where possible, smallest viable change.

3. Interfaces and API Contracts:
   - Public APIs: Inputs, Outputs, Errors.
   - Versioning Strategy.
   - Idempotency, Timeouts, Retries.
   - Error Taxonomy with status codes.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Budgets:
   - Performance: p95 latency, throughput, resource caps.
   - Reliability: SLOs, error budgets, degradation strategy.
   - Security: AuthN/AuthZ, data handling, secrets, auditing.
   - Cost: unit economics.

5. Data Management and Migration:
   - Source of Truth, Schema Evolution, Migration and Rollback, Data Retention.

6. Operational Readiness:
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces.
   - Alerting: thresholds and on-call owners.
   - Runbooks for common tasks.
   - Deployment and Rollback strategies.
   - Feature Flags and compatibility.

7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation:
   - Top 3 Risks, blast radius, kill switches/guardrails.

8. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Definition of Done (tests, scans).
   - Output Validation for format/requirements/safety.

9. Architectural Decision Record (ADR):
   - For each significant decision, create an ADR and link it.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After design/architecture work, test for ADR significance:

- Impact: long-term consequences? (e.g., framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- Alternatives: multiple viable options considered?
- Scope: cross‑cutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
📋 Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs. Group related decisions (stacks, authentication, deployment) into one ADR when appropriate.

## Authentication Implementation Notes (Phase 2 - JWT Auth)

### Overview
Phase 2 implemented JWT-based authentication for the Todo Backend API, transforming it from a single-user application to a secure multi-user system with proper user data isolation.

### Key Implementation Details

#### 1. JWT Token Verification
- **Location**: `backend/src/auth/jwt_handler.py`
- **Algorithm**: HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256)
- **Token Claims**: Requires `sub` (user ID) and `exp` (expiration) claims
- **Clock Skew Tolerance**: 10 seconds leeway for time synchronization issues
- **Error Handling**: Distinguishes between expired tokens (401) and invalid tokens (401)

#### 2. Authentication Flow
1. Frontend obtains JWT token from Better Auth after user login
2. Frontend includes token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
3. Backend extracts token via `get_current_user` dependency
4. `JWTHandler.verify_token()` validates signature and expiration
5. `JWTHandler.extract_user_id()` extracts user ID from token
6. User ID is used to filter data and verify ownership

#### 3. API Changes (Breaking)
- **Removed**: `user_id` from URL paths (was `/api/{user_id}/tasks`)
- **New**: All endpoints now at `/api/tasks/*` with authentication required
- **User ID Source**: Extracted from JWT token, not URL or request body
- **Authentication**: All endpoints (except root) require valid JWT Bearer token

#### 4. User Data Isolation
- **Implementation**: All queries filter by authenticated user's ID
- **Ownership Verification**: Two-step check for individual resource access:
  1. Check if resource exists (404 if not found)
  2. Check if user owns resource (403 if unauthorized)
- **Security Logging**: All unauthorized access attempts are logged with user IDs and resource IDs

#### 5. Error Response Standards
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing, invalid, or expired token
- **403 Forbidden**: Valid token but insufficient permissions (cross-user access)
- **404 Not Found**: Resource doesn't exist
- **422 Validation Error**: Invalid request data

#### 6. Security Features
- **Stateless Authentication**: No session storage, tokens are self-contained
- **Token Expiry**: Enforced on every request, expired tokens rejected
- **Secret Validation**: Minimum 32-character secret key required
- **No Secret Exposure**: JWT secret never appears in error messages or logs
- **Security Logging**: Unauthorized access attempts logged with context

#### 7. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: JWT handler token verification and user ID extraction
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end authentication flow for all endpoints
- **Contract Tests**: OpenAPI specification compliance with authentication
- **Test Coverage**: Authentication, authorization, token expiry, cross-user access

#### 8. Configuration
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: Shared secret for JWT verification (min 32 chars)
  - `JWT_ALGORITHM`: Algorithm for JWT signing (default: HS256)
  - `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
  - `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: INFO)

#### 9. Swagger UI Integration
- **Authorization Button**: Click "Authorize" to enter JWT token
- **Persistent Auth**: Token persists across page refreshes
- **Format**: Enter token as `Bearer <your-token>`
- **Documentation**: Updated API description with authentication instructions

#### 10. Known Limitations & Future Enhancements
- **No Refresh Tokens**: Tokens must be re-issued after expiration
- **No Token Revocation**: Tokens valid until expiration (stateless design)
- **No Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for production
- **No RBAC**: All authenticated users have same permissions (future: role-based access)

```

### Migration Guide for Existing Clients
1. **Obtain JWT Token**: Integrate with Better Auth to get user tokens
2. **Update API Calls**: Remove `user_id` from URL paths
3. **Add Authorization Header**: Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in all requests
4. **Handle 401/403 Errors**: Implement token refresh and permission error handling
5. **Update Base URL**: Change from `/api/{user_id}/tasks` to `/api/tasks`

### Performance Considerations
- **Authentication Overhead**: JWT verification adds ~5-10ms per request
- **No Database Lookups**: User ID extracted from token (no user table query)
- **Stateless Design**: Scales horizontally without session storage
- **Clock Skew Tolerance**: 10-second leeway prevents false expiration errors

### Security Best Practices Implemented
✓ Minimum 32-character secret key enforced
✓ Token expiration checked on every request
✓ User data isolation at database query level
✓ Ownership verification before resource access
✓ Security logging for unauthorized attempts
✓ No secrets in error messages or logs
✓ HTTPS recommended for production (tokens vulnerable over HTTP)
✓ Input validation on all endpoints
✓ Proper HTTP status codes for security errors
